# Akira: A Cross-platform Voice Control System

Voice control system that can be shared across multiple platforms, automating a variety of tasks for users.
This project aims to automate a variety of tasks for users, and improve general quality of life by connecting 
all user devices, regardless of brand or device type. By connecting user devices, users can seamlessly retrieve
data from device B, while using device A. If a user is far from home, for example, and has their phone, but forgot an important document
on their personal computer, then Akira can (prospectively) retrieve the document remotely and deliver to the user. 


## Contributions

Anybody is welcome to contribute to this project - contributions are encouraged. While I am working on this project without the intent 
of having additional developers consistently contributing to this repository, any contributions are welcomed and would bring
fresh, unique ideas to Akira. If issues are found, also please be sure to create an issue ticket! 

Any features being actively worked on are specified in the [Projects tab](https://github.com/RikiBorders/Akira-Voice-Control-System/projects?type=beta).
I will try to keep this as up to date as possible, though I'm unfortunately not psychic and cannot promise if that tab will be used
for the entire duration of this project's development.

General feature requests or contributions can be submitted by the [Issues tab](https://github.com/RikiBorders/Akira-Voice-Control-System/issues).
